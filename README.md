# Statistical Testing: Hypothesis and Chi-Square Tests

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of statistical testing using Python. It has two main projects: one centered on hypothesis testing and the other on chi-square testing. Both projects are designed to guide users through the theoretical foundations and practical applications of these tests, employing Python and R to perform data analysis.

## Projects Overview

### Hypothesis Testing Tutorial

The Hypothesis Testing project is an in-depth tutorial that introduces the concept of hypothesis testing in statistics. It covers the basics of setting up null and alternative hypotheses, choosing the appropriate test, calculating test statistics, and interpreting results. Through this project, users will learn how to apply hypothesis testing to sample datasets, gaining insights into its applications in comparing group means, testing proportions, and more.

### Chi-Square Test Tutorial

The Chi-Square Test project focuses on the chi-square test of independence, a non-parametric test used to determine if there's a significant association between two categorical variables. This tutorial walks users through the theory behind the chi-square test, its calculations, and how to interpret the results to make data-driven decisions.
